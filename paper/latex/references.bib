    abstract = {We present a global time series of street-network sprawl—that is, sprawl as measured through the local connectivity of the street network. Using high-resolution data from OpenStreetMap and a satellite-derived time series of urbanization, we compute and validate changes over time in multidimensional street connectivity measures based on graph-theoretic and geographic concepts. We report on global, national, and city-level trends since 1975 in the street-network disconnectedness index (SNDi), based on every mapped node and edge in the world. Streets in new developments in 90\% of the 134 most populous countries have become less connected since 1975, while just 29\% show an improving trend since 2000. The same period saw a near doubling in the relative frequency of a street-network type characterized by high circuity, typical of gated communities. We identify persistence in street-network sprawl, indicative of path-dependent processes. Specifically, cities and countries with low connectivity in recent years also had relatively low preexisting connectivity in our earliest time period. We discuss implications for policy intervention in road building in new and expanding cities as a top priority for sustainable urban development.},

The result is the most complete information system on cities to date with data for 11,422 quality controlled urban centres across 15 thematic domains, 471 indicators, and 2600 attributes. The UCDB has two data streams, one based on the fixed delineation of the 2025 boundaries, the other based on a multi-temporal delineation of entities and their tracking over time. The UCDB integrates data from Copernicus Services (including Emergency, Land Monitoring, Marine and Climate), peer-reviewed datasets (i.e. from the scientific literature), and institutional information systems (i.e. from the United Nations).},
